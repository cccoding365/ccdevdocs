# Version Control Systems

Version control systems allow you to track changes to your codebase/files over time. They allow you to go back to some previous version of the codebase without any issues. Also, they help in collaborating with people working on the same code – if you’ve ever collaborated with other people on a project, you might already know the frustration of copying and merging the changes from someone else into your codebase; version control systems allow you to get rid of this issue.

## How Git works

> Here is a basic overview of how Git works:

1. Create a "repository" (project) with a git hosting tool (like Bitbucket)
2. Copy (or clone) the repository to your local machine
3. Add a file to your local repo and "commit" (save) the changes
4. "Push" your changes to your main branch
5. Make a change to your file with a git hosting tool and commit
6. "Pull" the changes to your local machine
7. Create a "branch" (version), make a change, commit the change
8. Open a "pull request" (propose changes to the main branch)
9. "Merge" your branch to the main branch
